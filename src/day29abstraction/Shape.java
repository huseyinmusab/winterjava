	 Abstract Method:
	 Sometimes we need a method which has no body. These methods are called "abstract methods"
	 To create an abstract method you need to follow these three steps:
	   1)Remove the body
	   2)Put "abstract" keyword between access modifier and return type
	   3)Make the CLASS abstract. 
	   You can create abstract methods in ONLY abstract classes
